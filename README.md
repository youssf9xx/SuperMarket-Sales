# About the project
With the increasing focus on sustainable shopping, consumer preferences have shifted. I chose to analyze the sales data of a supermarket with three branches.

# About the dataset
The dataset provides information about online orders with order id, branch, costumer type, payment method, order date, city, sales amount, profits and rating.

# Questions for the analysis
1. Which branch made the most sales in the last month?
2. Which city has the highest average rating for customer satisfaction?
3. What product line has the highest total sales?  Which product line has the lowest total sales ?
4. What is the difference between the total made by members and non members ?
5. What is the distribution of sales across different times of the day?

# Key takeaway from dataset
1. The branch who made most sales is Branch A, followed by C and B.
2. Naypyitaw City has the highest average rating for customer satisfaction which is 7.07 and Yangon comes second with a rating of 7.03 and last Mandalay with a 6.82 rating.
