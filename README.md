About the project
With the significant increase of inflation, groceries's prices have also been rising quickly. I decided to pick a grocery store to analyze their sales in 4 years.

About the dataset
The dataset is not based on actual sales of Supermart, but is used only for the purpose for analysis. The dataset provides information about online orders with order id, category, sub category, order date, region, sales amount, discount amount, profits and states.

Questions for the analysis
What is the sales trend in 4 years (2015-2018)?
Which category has the highest sales? Which category has the highest profits?
What is the average profit margins?
What region has the highest sales?
What steps should marketing department take in the future to increase sales?
Key takeaway (Answers to questions 1-4)
From 2015-2018, 2017 and 2018 sales exeeded the average sales of those 4 year. Sales in 2018 increased by 30.5% relative to 2017. Supermart's sales have drops in the first quarter of the year (especially January and February) and peaks in the last quarter of the year. This could be due to holidays shopping demands.
Eggs, Meat and Fish has the highest sales among all categories. However, Snacks brings the highest profit among all. In subcategories, health drinks and soft drinks have highest sales and profits.
Average profit margin is around 25%.
West region has the highest sales while North has the least sales. West's sales is 3,826% higher than North region sales.
Recommendation (Answer to question 5)
Supermart sales have increased significantly in 2017 and 2018. The company can further expand sales by focus on north region's marketing strategies. It is recommended that companies investigate reasons why North perform poorly and provides solutions accordingly.
Company can also avoid stocking too much inventory in the first quarter and prepare for higher demand for the end of the year (September, November, and December).
Even though Health drinks and Soft drinks bring most sales and profits, animal products like Eggs, Meat and Fish still bring the highest totals sales and Snacks has highest profits. Company should still focus on those two categories while stocking the inventories. For futher analysis, number of units sold will provide additional information.
